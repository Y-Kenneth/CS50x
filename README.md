# Week-4-Memory

On week 4 of CS50, i probably learned the most difficult function (that people believe) in C, which is Pointers. I also learned some functions from stdlib.h such as malloc and free, then some new types from stdint.h such as uint8_t and int16_t. Then i also learned file pointers such as fopen, fclose, fread, fwrite, etc.. Which was fun. I made some unique codes, like turning black pixels into colors that i want, then increasing the volume of a file, etc. But i think file pointers are also very difficult to write. I feel like, if i don't touch them for a week, i will instantly forget about em.
But so far, i'm kinda glad that i understood many functions in this week 4. Honestly i even understood pointers way more than sortings and searchings algorithms lol :v
